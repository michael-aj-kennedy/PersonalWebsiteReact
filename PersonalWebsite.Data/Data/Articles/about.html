<div class="entry-content">         <p>As a full-stack software developer with almost 15 years of industry experience I’ve been involved in a number of ongoing software development projects using both windows and web-based technologies. I’m proficient in juggling multiple projects and have a keen eye for detail, in particular I harbour a strong passion toward the design and UX aspects of product development.</p>  <p>I have experience of managing the technical aspects of projects, vetting and delegating change requests, liaising with other stakeholders and regularly work with other team members to help improve both their product and technical knowledge.</p>  <p>Family is the most important thing in the world. We’ve had lots to deal with in recent years, but I try to make those experiences work in my favour, giving me the strength and determination to do better each day. While it may sound like a cliché I truly believe that life is too short to do otherwise.</p>  </div>
