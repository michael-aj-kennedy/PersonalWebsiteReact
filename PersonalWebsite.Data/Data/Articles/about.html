		<p>As a full-stack developer with 15+ years of industry experience I've worked with a number of products, client projects and internal systems. That experience began with a year in technical support, assisting some 700 clients with their veterinary practice management systems. This transitioned into a data migration development role and then to multi-site document management system migrations.</p>
		<p>I took the opportunity to transfer to a software development team working on inhouse development projects, primarily using C# and .Net alongside both windows and web technologies. Initially within a consultancy environment where I learnt how to quickly swap between multiple ongoing projects.</p>
		<p>Juggling work on multiple in-house products and client work means that I can work both to stringent specifications and on projects where flexibility has been granted on design and technology. This has helped me to develop a keen eye for detail, in particular I harbour a strong passion toward the carefully considered design and UX aspects of product development while being able to make quick technological decisions when the situation calls for it.</p>
		<p>I’m a firm believer in that working in technology requires constant learning and reassessing of approaches, if we can’t look back at 6 month old code and find something that can be improved then we’re doing something wrong. With this approach in mind, I’ve had exposure to newer technologies/techniques in recent years (Angular, .Net Core, .Net 6, Git Actions, TDD) and am keen to expand my knowledge further.</p>
		<p>The creative and puzzle solving aspects of writing software is a particular draw for me, particularly when working with the right team. Writing code is an art form and I firmly believe that the best results can be achieved where members of the team have an emotional connection to a product.</p>
		<p>Outside of work, family is the most important thing in the world. We’ve had lots to deal with in recent years, but I try to make those experiences work in my favour, giving me the strength and determination to do better each day. While it may sound like a cliché I truly believe that life is too short to do otherwise.</p>
