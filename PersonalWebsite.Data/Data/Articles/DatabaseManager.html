		Database upgrade processes for corporate products can end up taking on a life of their own as each upgrade adds to the plethora of upgrade scripts. With older products this means that the upgrade process is so complex that the upgrade process itself may as well be considered a separate product in its own right.<br/><br/>

    <div class="content">
		<p>As part of the initial release of version 5 of Tikit eMarketing, we wanted to remove the need for customers or the implementation team to execute various SQL scripts in order to create or upgrade the database. With this in mind, I created an automated upgrade tool which would analyse the schema of the target database and apply changes as required.</p>
		<p>In recent years, I've been able to expand on this tool so that it can be used by multiple products.</p>
		<p>Database Manager consists of three primary processes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				A database scan process which examines the content of a selected SQL database and outputs a collection of generated database scripts and structures representing all database objects (tables, columns, constraints, triggers, keys, indexes, views, data types, functions & procedures).</br>
				This process also queries default database content based on pre-configured select statements and stores this within the output.
			</li>
			<li>A plugin component which contains details of the development database including output of the above process and a myriad list of configuration options (default database name, collation, custom scripts etc).</li>
			<li>A database upgrade executable, holding all shared code.  It runs the first process against the targeted database, compares the output with the counterpart held within the plugin runs a comparison. The results from which are used to compile a list of upgrade operations in order to bring the target database up to the level of the original development model.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The database upgrade process needs to be cautious of any custom changes that may have been applied to the targeted database. With this in mind, Database Manager will never remove directly remove objects of columns from the target database, nor will it reduce the length of database fields or delete records from existing tables.</p>

		<p>This process allows Database Manager to create or upgrade a database without any many complex scripts, it takes the complication out of the hands of implementation teams or end-users and reduces support calls caused by bodged database upgrades.</p>
		<p>There are of course any number of situations where a purely automated upgrade cannot run, particularly when changing the data type on primary key fields or when moving between disparate data types.</p>
		<p>For this purpose, Database Manager supports functionality to execute both SQL scripts and explicit code as part of any upgrade process.  This allows specific steps to be taken both before and after completion of the upgrade process in order to negate any issues that cannot otherwise be fully automated. </p>
		<p>This has the advantage that we're not just restricted to database upgrade operations, but we can now execute other database maintenance tasks from a single application, such as data migration and import operations.</p>
		<p>In a similar vein, the information we need to collect additional data when creating a new database is dependent on the target product, rather as we would do with InstallShield.  Database Manager provides the ability to add custom screens to the UI to collect information from the end-user, this data is then accessible from post upgrade operations stored within the plugin component.</p>
		<img src="/content/images/DatabaseManager/4.png" alt="Upgrade completion example" loading="lazy" />
		<p>Finally, once all database upgrade operations have completed, we apply the version number of our product specific plugin component to a field within the database - this allows us to verify that our product is running against the correct database version and also allows prevention of accidental database downgrades.</p>
		<p>Once this has completed we execute a re-index and update of database statistics - because not all clients are clever enough to have maintenance plans configured on their SQL servers.</p>
		<p>After this has completed, the user is presented with a success message and is able to save upgrade logs which includes a summary of completed operations along with full logging of any errors that may have been encountered. </p>
