        <p>The second version of my personal website was written using Angular and .Net Core.</p>
        <p>As part of the development of this site, I reused existing server-side components from the first version, upgrading them from .Net Framework 4.6 to .Net Core.</p>
        <p>The approach taken here allowed me to concentrate on the angular front-end while reusing as much existing code as possible.</p>
