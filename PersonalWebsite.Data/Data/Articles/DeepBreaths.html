We bare witness, for you
<br>
because it's what we must do
<br>
gather courage to enter
<br>
deep breaths to find our centre
<br>
contemplate the day ahead
<br>
to hear the tale of your bloodshed
<br>
our fear and trepidation
<br>
give way to complex feelings of frustration
<br>
as the cameras watch our movements
<br>
we wonder if we're here for their amusement
<br>
<br>
We bare witness, for you
<br>
as you're unable to
<br>
gently take our seats
<br>
deep breaths to steady our heartbeats
<br>
no way we could prepare
<br>
for now we have to sit and stare
<br>
silently we listen
<br>
slowly our eyes glisten
<br>
as those who never knew thee
<br>
narrate your final story
<br>
<br>
We bare witness, for you
<br>
and those who your injuries tried to undo
<br>
overwhelming emotion
<br>
deep breaths holding back the ocean
<br>
we cannot be protected
<br>
as we listen to the detective
<br>
course of events become crystal clear
<br>
hard as it is for us to hear
<br>
realise now that all is told
<br>
shattered hearts for all involved
<br>
<br>
We bare witness, for you
<br>
hear how life went askew
<br>
doctor sits at the table
<br>
deep breaths tell of someone unstable
<br>
offers of help declined
<br>
insisted nothing wrong with mind
<br>
wouldn't hurt our family
<br>
not suffering from insanity
<br>
withheld something more was planned
<br>
refused help and now is damned
<br>
<br>
We bare witness for you
<br>
denied our chance to say adieu
<br>
one thing missing from this day
<br>
deep breaths cannot take away
<br>
we will never hear a reason
<br>
an explanation for this treason
<br>
the one soul who could respond
<br>
can no longer correspond
<br>
leaving us bewildered why
<br>
our loved one travelled to the sky
<br>
<br>
We bear witness, for you
<br>
there's nothing else we can do
<br>
upon reaching the conclusion
<br>
deep breaths temper our confusion
<br>
that someone whom we trusted
<br>
could make us feel disgusted
<br>
waited for you in your home
<br>
as you returned there all alone
<br>
to leave you laying lifeless
<br>
when you only offered kindness
<br>
<br>
We bare witness, for you
<br>
knowing we must continue
<br>
try to put aside our fears
<br>
deep breaths no longer hold back the tears
<br>
every morning when we wake
<br>
understanding what's at stake
<br>
life can never be the same
<br>
every time we hear your name
<br>
reminds us we've been taught
<br>
how easy life can be cut short
<br>
<br>
We bear witness, for ourselves
<br>
hoping you have found peace
<br>
in our dreams you point and say
<br>
don't sit there and waste away
<br>
