		<p>As another chapter drew to a close,<br>
		we looked back at what arose.</p>

		<p>Unable to deny what’s now missing,<br>
		hope that somehow you’re there listening.</p>

		<p>Celebrating your achievements,<br>
		lightens feelings of bereavement.</p>

		<p>Yet even now we know you’d say,<br>
		pull yourself up don’t dare fade away.</p>

		<p>Missing pieces make us who we are,<br>
		when we let them become our guiding stars.</p>

		<p>They inspire us in a unique way,<br>
		never leave us feeling grey.</p>

		<p>Whenever it seems we’re lost at sea,<br>
		just look to the sky …and there they’ll be.</p>

		<p>At a burning flame we stare,<br>
		feel their presence waiting there.</p>

		<p>Whispering inside our ear,<br>
		even though no sound we hear.</p>

		<p>Lead us where we need to be,<br>
		missing pieces,<br>
		of our family.</p>
