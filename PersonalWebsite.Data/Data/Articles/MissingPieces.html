As another chapter drew to a close,<br>
we looked back at what arose.<br>
<br>
Unable to deny what’s now missing,<br>
hope that somehow you’re there listening.<br>
<br>
Celebrating your achievements,<br>
lightens feelings of bereavement.<br>
<br>
Yet even now we know you’d say,<br>
pull yourself up don’t dare fade away.<br>
<br>
Missing pieces make us who we are,<br>
when we let them become our guiding stars.<br>
<br>
They inspire us in a unique way,<br>
never leave us feeling grey.<br>
<br>
Whenever it seems we’re lost at sea,<br>
just look to the sky …and there they’ll be.<br>
<br>
At a burning flame we stare,<br>
feel their presence waiting there.<br>
<br>
Whispering inside our ear,<br>
even though no sound we hear.<br>
<br>
Lead us where we need to be,<br>
missing pieces,<br>
of our family.<br>
<br>
